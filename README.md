# Side Project Contributor Agreement

This is supposed to be fun, but there's some chance that a company could be formed around this sooner or later.  This agreement designed to protect everyone if that happens.

Before a company is formed:

1. Every hour you work on the project gives you one vote towards its future.  "Majority" means "by hours worked", not individuals.  In the absence of evidence to the contrary, contemporaneous weekly self-reported hours will be trusted.

2. The code, documentation, and other resources in this project are for project members' eyes only.

3. Members may invite others, subject to majority approval.

4. Members retain rights to their own work, but grant a perpetual unlimited license to the company that may be formed resulting from this agreement, and its successors and assignees.

5. A majority of members may choose to start a company together.  80% of the equity in the resulting company shall be split equally per-person between the co-founders on a typical four year vesting schedule, and 20% shall vest immediately to all of the members, in proportion to hours worked before company formation.

Once the company is formed:

1. The requirement for existing members not to share project/company secrets shall continue.

2. Otherwise, the project will end.
